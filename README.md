SECURE IMAGE TRANSMISSION THROUGH OPEN NETWORK
This project showcases an image encryption and decryption method using two chaos-based algorithms: Arnold Cat Map and Henon Map. These methods scramble the pixel positions of an image to enhance its security. The project also includes visualization of the original, encrypted, and decrypted images, along with their histograms to observe pixel intensity changes.
Features:
Image Encryption: Uses the Arnold Cat Map and Henon Map to scramble image pixels, making the image unrecognizable.
Image Decryption: Restores the original image by applying the inverse transformations.
Visualization: Displays the original, encrypted, and decrypted images, alongside histograms showing pixel intensity distributions before and after encryption.
Algorithms Used:
1. Arnold Cat Map:
A chaotic transformation that repositions image pixels based on a mathematical formula. Applying this map multiple times scrambles the pixel positions.
2. Henon Map:
A 2D chaotic map used for scrambling pixel values to further enhance security.
